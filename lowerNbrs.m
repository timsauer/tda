function [lNbrs, Mdim] = lowerNbrs( N, edges )
%The lower-Nbrs function as described in Zomorodian's "Fast Construction of
%the Vaetoris-Rips Complex.
%   The input is a matrix whose colums correspond to endpoints of edges and
%   a weight for each edges in a Neighborhood Graph. For more information
%   regarding the format of edges, see VRExpansion.

%N=number of data points

%Sort the columns by weight. This is so that we can choose an ordering that
%creates a filtration by distance. THIS MIGHT BE UNNECESSARY!

edges=sortrows(edges', 3)';

%Using a matrix
lNbrs=zeros(N,N); 
Mdim=zeros(1,N);

% ordering is a vector that lists the vector out in order of occurence in
% edges. 

 ordering=unique(edges(2,:));
 inputsize=size(ordering);

 for i= ordering %This might be faster as a for loop going through all edges.
